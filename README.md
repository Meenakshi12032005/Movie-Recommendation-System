💡 Built My First Movie Recommendation System! 🎬✨

Over the past few days, I worked on creating a Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences.
I implemented it using Python, Flask, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, and deployed it on localhost for testing.

🔍 Features:

Content-based filtering using cosine similarity

Simple web interface with Flask

Takes a movie name and suggests similar movies 🎥

📚 Tech Stack:

Python

Flask (for web app on localhost)

Pandas & Scikit-learn (for recommendation logic)

This project helped me understand how real-world platforms like Netflix and Amazon build their recommendation engines.

👉 Next Step: Expanding the dataset and improving the UI with modern frontend tools.

localhost: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

I’d love to hear your feedback! 💬
